This is a software for a journal, using firebase as the database. Journal updates in real time across all pages, and is responsive.
The database key is NOT in the repo. If forked, or cloned, user will have to use their own database key.


syntax for that would be: 

export const appSettings = {

    databaseURL: "{input info here}.firebaseio.com/"

}
